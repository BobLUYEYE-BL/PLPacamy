Here's a README file for your mini calculator script:

# Mini Calculator

A simple Python script that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Supports decimal numbers (floats).
- Calculates and displays:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. See the results printed for all four operations.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
```

## Notes

- The script assumes the user will not enter zero for the second number, so no error handling for division by zero is implemented.
- Feel free to expand it with error checking or additional operations!

## Code Overview

The script:
- Takes two float inputs from the user.
- Computes sum, difference, product, and quotient.
- Prints the results.

Enjoy your mini-calculator! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’»

### Code Snippet

```
# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Perform calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Display results
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
```
